# dhall-ci-timbertson

This repository provides my own personal utilities for [dhall-ci](https://github.com/timbertson/dhall-ci),
you should go there for more details.


You shouldn't use this repository directly (I'll change things on a whim),
but it serves as a useful example of a high level `dhall-ci` repository.
Rather than providing many low-level building blocks, it provides
high level reusable data and functions for different repository types.
